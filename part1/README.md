# Part 1
  
Welcome to the first part of CodeBase's tutorial on building a backend for your spiffy new website. For this tutorial, we'll be using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/) as our backend web service. Flask is a lightweight framework written for Python that allows you to easily handle requests or make your own to any external APIs. A lot of this tutorial comes from the official flask tutorial, so be sure to cross reference with their website and check their documentation if anything here seems confusing.

Part 1 of the lesson is dedicated to teaching you how to properly set up your file directory and manage your packages - both highly important in keeping your project maintainable and easy to modify in the future.
